I am professor for Security Engineering and speaker of the Horst-Görtz Institute for IT-Security (HGI) at Ruhr-Universität Bochum. With its more than 30 dedicated professorships and the cluster of excellence CASA, the HGI at Bochum is one of the largest security hot spots in Europe. Since 2016, I am also affiliated with the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). My personal research interests are in applied cryptography, secure processor architectures and hardware security.
